My purpose for it is to learn about how various events within and out of Canada have affected the grades of both universities. I'm curious about how world events can affect students and their education. I want to know if there are significant changes in the grades in semesters with major events(strikes, pandemic, etc.) Also I'd like to see if there is an increase of the grade average over the years, to show whether students are getting better at school. I can see a sort of dashboard that users could look at a graph. It would be something simple that enders the data in a nice layout that is easy to read.

The data set is the grade distribution from ubcv and ubco. The data is provided by the University of British Columbia. It is also from both the Vancouver and the Okanagan campuses. The data itself is about the grade distribution for just about every class during 2 different time periods. For UBCV the data is collected from 1996 to present and for UBCO the data is collected from 2021 to present. The data was collected from the servers and through professors inputing it into the servers. The data itself is meant for helping with planning and making of campus decisions.
